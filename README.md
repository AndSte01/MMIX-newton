# MMIX-newton
© Andreas Steger 2023

An implementation of a [newton algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) for determining roots of 4th order polynomials implemented in MMIX assembler. The derivative is calculated using a simple [difference quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_quotient).

This program was developed during the _Kleingruppen Übungen_ of the lecture _Grundlagen der modernen Informationstechnologie_ of the winter semester 2023/2024

The documentation is in german.

## Files
`Newton Grafisch.ggb`: graphical drawing of the problem with the parameters used in the program. Open in [GeoGebra](https://geogebra.org/calculator)

`Newton.mms`: The implementation of the algorithm using MMIX assembler

## Running the code
To run the code you need an MMIX emulator. The [MMIX Visual Debugger](https://www.mmix.cs.hm.edu/mmixvd/help/mmixvd.html) ([download](https://www.mmix.cs.hm.edu/mmixvd/index.html)) is recommended for doing so.

## Further Information
Some more information about the MMIX and it's architecture can be found at the official [MMIX Website](https://www.mmix.cs.hm.edu/)
